    <h1>Lydia's Mozilla HTML and CSS practice page</h1>
    <p>I'm using this webpage to learn HTML and CSS as part of my 2026 J-term class: Programming for Policymakers.</p>
    <p>I had some experience with HTML prior to the class, but I appreciate this opportunity to deepen my knowledge.</p>
    <ul>Some thing I've learned so far are:
        <li>All webpages run on HTML, CSS, and Java Script. </li>
        <li>Backend elements might use other coding languages</li>
        <li>AI can help with a lot of coding these days! But it's important to have an understanding of the foundations in order to use AI in an effective and informed way. </li>
    </ul>
